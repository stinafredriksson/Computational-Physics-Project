# Computational Physcis: Final Project

**Project 1 and 2:  Particle scattering events for different potentials**

The main task of this project is to analyze particle scattering events, or more precisely the final scattering angle's dependency on the impact parameter. This is done both analytically by deriving the solution for square potential scattering and by approximating using numerical quadrature (Boole). An additional parameter which also will be studied is the effect of the relation between the initial kinetic energy and the potential, as well as the sign of the potential. The numerical approximations of the final scattering angle and the differential cross-section are also performed when using the Lennard Jones potential.

**Project 3 and 4: Ising model**

This project aims to analyze the thermodynamic properties of a magnetic material by using the so called Ising model in two dimensions and Monte Carlo methods. The thermodynamic properties examined are magnetization, susceptibility and specific heat while varying the temperature and the size of the systems. This is done for ferro and antiferromagnetic material with and without an external magnetic field. 

For the case of ferromagnetic material and a zero valued external field, the phase transition temperature is also obtained using the fourth order cumulants of the systems. Finally, the results and efficiency when using the Metropolis algorithm will be compared with when using the heat bath algorithm (for ferromagnetic material, no external magnetic field). 

The project report is the file called final_report.pdf.
